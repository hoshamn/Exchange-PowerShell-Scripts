.Synopsis
   Script to automatically take an Exchange 2013 Server out of Maintenance Mode.
   
   Current Version: 1.5

   Version History:
   v1.5: remove the need to dot-source the script before running
   v1.4: included code to restart transport services after changing the component states. Added additional check for component states.
         General code improvements. Better remoting support (script can now be executed from a remote server, even for DAG members)
         Better error-handling, improved logic
   v1.3: included code to redirect messages from the server that is to be put in maintenance mode to another server.
   v1.2: included code to exclude poision a Shadow Redundancy queue when checking if all queues were empty

.DESCRIPTION
   This script is created to automatically take an Exchange 2013 Server out of Maintenance Mode. 
   It will automatically detect if the server is a Mailbox Server and then take appropriate additional actions, if any.

   To execute the script, you will have to dot-source it first after which you can call the cmdlet: "Stop-ExchangeServerMaintenanceMode"
.EXAMPLE
   Running the following command will take a server called "Server1" out of Maintenance Mode:

   Stop-ExchangeServerMaintenanceMode.ps1 -Server Server1
